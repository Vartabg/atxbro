**VetNav Module - Phase 1: Foundational Content Implemented (Partial)**

* **Date**: 2025-05-29
* **Change**: Implemented the core HTML structure for the VetNav card's header and the primary list of benefit categories (Health Care, Disability Compensation, Pension, Education, Housing Assistance).
* **Purpose**: This is the first step in Phase 1 of the VetNav module integration, aiming to provide users with an immediate, clear overview of major VA benefit areas. This work directly addresses the "Lack of Awareness and Information Gaps" barrier identified in the `vetnavDeepResearch3.txt` research document. The categories are presented as links (currently placeholders) for future navigation to official VA resources. This aligns with the ATXBRO project goal of creating a helpful, Austin-centric experience by guiding local veterans to essential services.
* **Files Affected**: `src/index.html`
* **Next Steps**: Add specific styling for `vetnav-link` items if needed, populate placeholder links with official VA URLs, add Critical Support Links and Local Resource sections to the VetNav card.
